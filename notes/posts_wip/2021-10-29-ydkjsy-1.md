## Infor & Preface

- Full name: **You Don't Know JS Yet** (2nd edition)
- Author: **Kyle Simpson**
- [getify/You-Dont-Know-JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) on Github
- It's not just for starters, but ==for all developers== who want to understand deeper.
- "_The primary point of the title “You Don’t Know JS Yet” is to point out that most JS developers don’t take the time to really understand how the code that they write works._"
- "_My suggestion is you take your time going through YDKJSY. Take one chapter, read it completely through start to finish, and then go back and re-read it section by section. Stop in between each section, and practice the code or ideas from that section. For larger concepts, it probably is a good idea to expect to spend several days ==digesting, re-reading, practicing==, then digesting some more._"

## Chap 1 — What is JS?

### What's With That Name?

- Not related with Java at all, not just a script but a programming language.
- "Java" → attract mostlty Java programmers, "Script" → lighweight.
- Official name specified by [TC39](https://tc39.es/) as "**ECMAScript" (ES).**
- ==JS in browsers or Node.js is an implementation of ES2019 standard==.
- Hosted by ECMA.
- Don't use "JS6" or "ES8", use "ES20xx" or "JS".

### Language Specification

- Who decides a new version of JS? → ==[TC39](https://tc39.es/)== (~50-100 members) by votes via [5 stages](https://tc39.es/process-document/).
- There is **just one JS** in the wild (not multiple versions).
- **Environments run JS**: browsers, servers, robots, lightbulbs,....
- Not all are JS, eg. `alert("Hello, JS!")` or `console.log()` ← they're just APIs of JS environments.
  - There are many "JS-looking" APIs: `fetch()`, `getCurrentLocation()`, `getUserMedia()`,...
  - They follow JS rules but just "guests", not official JS specifications.
- Complain "_JS is so inconsistent_!" ← it's because the environment hehaviors work, not because of JS itself!
- **Developer Tools** (Inspect Element in Chrome, for example) are... tools for developers. They're NOT JS environment!
  - ==Something works in Dev Tool, doesn't mean JS compiler will understand it.==

### Many Faces

- **Paradigm-level code categories**
  - _Procedural_: organizes codes in a top-down, linear progression. ← eg. C
  - _Object-oriented_ (OO/classes): organizes codes into classes. ← eg. Java/C++
  - _Functional_ (FP): organizes codes into functions. ← eg. Haskell
  - ==JS is a _multi-paradigm_ language.== → "*meaning the syntax and capabilities allow a developer to mix and match (and bend and reshape!) concepts from various major paradigms*"

### Backwards & Forwards

- **Backwards compatibility**:

  - ==Code from the past should still work today== — "_we don't break the web_" (TC39)
  - <u>Idea</u>: JS developer can write code with confidence → their code won't stop working in new released versions.
  - Once it’s in JS, it can’t be taken out because it might break programs, even if we’d
    really, really like to remove it!
  - <u>My idea to remember</u>: old codes work with new engines but old engines may not work with old codes.

- **Forward compatibility**:

  - ==Code from future don't break the web today==.
  - CSS & HTML is forward, not backward!
  - Codes from the past may not work / work the same today.
  - Feature from 2019 in a browser 2010 → page isn't broken! Unrecognized things will be skipped!
  - <u>My idea to remember</u>: old engines work with new code but old codes may not work with new engine.

- ==JS is backwards compatibility + not forward compability==

  - Codes written today, will work in future JS engines.
  - Codes written today may be broken in old JS engines.

- **Why**?

  - "Markup" (HTML) / "Styling" (CSS) languages → easier to "skip over".
  - "Programming language" (JS) → cannot skip something it doesn't understand (the rest may be effected!)

- **Fill the gaps?**

  - JS has "forward-compability problems" (FC) (not compatible with old engines)

  - How today codes can be used in an old engine? → use ==**transpiling**== (using a tool to convert a source code of a program from one form to another)

  - FC problems **related syntax** → use a **transpiler** (eg. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) — ==convert "new" JS syntax to "older" syntax.==

      ::: col-2-equal

    ```js
    // New
    if (something) {
        let x = 3; // "let" was added in ES6 (2015)
        console.log(x);
    } else {
        let x = 4; // "let" → block scope
        console.log(x);
    }
    ```

    ```js
    // Old
    var x$0, x$1; // different variables
    if (something) {
        x$0 = 3; // diferent variables
        console.log(x$0);
    } else {
        x$1 = 4;
        console.log(x$1);
    }
    ```

      :::

  - "*It’s strongly ==recommended that developers use the latest version of JS== so that their code is clean and communicates its ideas most effectively.*" ← ==Let the tools take care of converting==.

  - FC problems **related to missing API method** → use **==polyfill==** (aka "shim"). ← Normally, a transpiler like Babel will detect and add it automatically.

    ```js
    // NEW: .finally() ← ES2019
    // getSomeRecords() returns us a promise for some // data it will fetch
    var pr = getSomeRecords();
    // show the UI spinner while we get the data
    startSpinner();
    pr.then(renderRecords) // render if successful
      .catch(showError) // show an error if not
      .finally(hideSpinner) // always hide the spinner
    ```

    ```js
    // OLD:
    if (!Promise.prototype.finally) { // prevents running on engines already has this API
      Promise.prototype.finally = function f(fn){ // define new for old engines
            return this.then(
          function t(v){
                    return Promise.resolve( fn() )
                .then(function t(){
                            return v; });
                        }, function c(e){}
        );
        };
    }
    ```

### What's in an Interpretation?

![img](../img_post/2021-10-29-ydkjsy-1/img-20211030155326706.png){:.img-60}
*[Source of the image](https://techytalks007.blogspot.com/2016/08/let-us-know-what-are-difference-between.html).*

- To clearify JS is interpreted or compiled → see how errors are handled.

- Historically, scripted/interpreted languages were executed a top-down, line-by-line

  ![image-20211030214022778](../img_post/2021-10-29-ydkjsy-1/image-20211030214022778.png){:.img-80}
  *Interpreted./Scripted Execution. Lines 1-4 must be executed before finding an error in line 5.*

- **Parsing** whole process before any execution,

  ![image-20211030214228849](../img_post/2021-10-29-ydkjsy-1/image-20211030214228849.png){:.img-70}
  *Parsing + Compilation + Execution. An error in line 5 would be caught in parsing phase before any execution.*

- "Parsed" language 🤝 "compiled" language: All compiled are parsed.

- JS code is parsed before it's executed. → =="early errors"== → **JS is a parsed language**

- **==JS is closer to compiled than interpreted==** (but not clearly a compiled or clearly a interpreted) → "*meaning the tools (including the JS engine) process and verify a program (reporting any errors!) before it executes.*"

- **Flow of a JS source program**:

  ![image-20211030215050566](../img_post/2021-10-29-ydkjsy-1/image-20211030215050566.png){:.img-70}
  *Parsing, Compiling, and Executing JS.*

  1. Program leaves IDE → transpiled by Babel → packed by Webpack → ... → **form1** → delivered to a JS engine.
  2. JS engine parses the code to an AST (*Abstract Syntax Tree*) ← subsequent execution: form1 > AST > executable form.
  3. Engine convert that AST to a kind-of byte code → then to JIT (*just in time*) compiler.
  4. JS VM executes the program.

- **Web Assembly (WASM)** → ==augments what the web (including JS) can accomplish.==

  - 2013, "**ASM.js**" (a subset of JS lang, *transpiled from C*) was introduced (by Mozilla) to demonstrate the performance of JS engine where it can run an Unreal 3 game at full 60fps. → ASM.js is just a transpiled language (not for coding).
  - After ASM.js > another group (also Mozilla's) released **Web Assembly (WASM)** ← provide a path for non-JS program (like C) to be converted to a form that could run in the JS engine.
    - ==WASM's format is entirely unlike JS== → skipping the parsing/compilation JS engine normally does
    - codes → WASM parsing/compilation → binary packed (easier for JS engine to understand) > JS engine execute them.
    - <u>Ex</u>: Go program has threaded programming → WASM convert it → JS engine can understand (JS no need to have something like threads feature)
    - 💡==TC39 aren't stressed to add more features (from other "concurrent" languages) → just keep their rules, WASM will make the bridge.==
  - ==WASM isn't only for the web, also isn't JS==.

### *Strictly* Speaking

- ES5 (2009) → "**strict mode**" → encourage better JS programs.

- **Why**?

  - Not a restriction but rather a "guide" so that JS engine can optimize and effectciently run the code.
  - Prevent some "stupid" coding ways when working in group, for example.

- In form of "*early errors*" → ex: disallows naming 2 function parameters the same.

- Some examples

  ```js
  // only whitespace and comments are allowed
  // before the use-strict pragma
  "use strict";
  // the rest of the file runs in strict mode
  ```

  ```js
  // Per function scope
  // Used when you wanna convert non-strict to strict programs
  function someOperations() {
    // whitespace and comments are fine here "use strict";
    // all this code will run in strict mode
  }
  ```

- Cannot be default → otherwise, it will break "backward compatibility" rule.

- ==Virtually, all transpiled codes (codes in production) ends up in strict mode.==

## Chap 2 — Surveying JS

- The best way to learn JS is to start writing JS.
- ==**Goal**: get a better *feel*== for it, so that we can move forward writing our own programs with more confidence.

### Each File is a Program

- In JS, ==each standalone file is its own separate program==. ← for error handling.
- How multiple files talk together? → <u>Only way</u>: sharing their **state** + use "**global scope**".
- ES6 → **module** (also a file-based) ← files are imported to module and be considered as a single module.
  - JS does still treat each module separately
- A JS file: either *standardlone* or *module*.

### Value

- Values come in 2 forms in JS: **primitive** and **object**

- **Primitive**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `null`, `symbol`

  - *literals*: `string`, `number`, `boolean`

    - `string` literals, eg: `const name = "Thi."` ← Using `""` or `''` is optional but ==should pick one and to use it consistently throughout the program.==

      ```js
      // Also can use backtick ``
      console.log("My name is ${name}.") // Output: My name is ${name}.
      console.log(`My name is ${name}.`) // Output: My name is Thi.
      ```

      This is called an **interpolation**

    - `number`, eg. `3.14` or `Math.PI`

    - `boolean`: `true`, `false`.

  - The "emptiness": **undefined**, **null** (They're not the same!) → ==it’s safest and best to use only `undefined` as the single empty value==

  - `symbol`, eg. `const a = Symbol("meaning of life")` ← Symbols are mostly used in low-level code such as in libraries and frameworks.

- **Arrays**:

  ```js
  names = ["France", 1, null]
  names.length // 3
  names[0] // France
  typeof names // "object" ← yep!

  // array can contains a function
  const func = () → true;
  arr = [func, 1]
  typeof func // "function"
  ```

  <u>Fact</u>: JS array indices are 0-based (eg. `a[0]`)

- **Objects**: an unordered, keyed collection of any various values

  ```js
  name = {
    first: "Thi",
    last: "Dinh",
    age: 30,
    specialties: [ "JS", "Drawing" ]
  };
  console.log(`My name is ${ name.first }.`); // My name is Thi.
  ```

- **Value Type Determination**:

  ```js
  typeof 42;                    // "number"
  typeof "abc";                 // "string"
  typeof true;                  // "boolean"
  typeof undefined;             // "undefined"
  typeof null;                  // "object" ← yep!
  typeof { "a": 1 };            // "object"
  typeof [1,2,3];               // "object" ← yep!
  typeof function hello(){};    // "function"
  ```

### **Declaring and Using Variables**

- `var` vs `let`

  ```js
  var adult = true;
  if (adult) {
    var name = "Thi"; // ← "var" says "this variable will be seen by a wider scope"
    let age = 30; // ← "let" limit access to "block scope"
  }
  console.log(name) // Thi
  console.log(age) // Error!
  ```

  **Note**: ==`var` should be avoided in favor of `let` (or `const`)== → prevent confusing in scoping behaviors.

- `let` vs `const` ← must give `const` an initial value and cannot re-assign.

  ```js
  const somethingToBeAssignedLater; // Error!
  const myBirthday = true;
  let age;
  age = 30;
  if (myBirthday) {
      age=age+1; //OK!
    myBirthday = false; // Error!
  }
  ```

- However,

  ```js
  const odds = [1, 3, 5];
  odds[1] = 7;    // OK :(
  odds = [];      // Error!
  ```

- 💡 Use `const` when you need a meaningful variable like `myBirthDay` instead of just `true` . **Also**, ==with primitive values, `const` helps avoid confusion due to reassignment problems==.

### Functions

- In JS, the word "functions" takes a broader meaning of "procedure" — a collection of statements can be invoked many times.

- Different types,

  ```js
  // Function declaration ← appear as a statement by itself
  function functionName(coolThings) {
    // ...
    return returnedValue;
  }
  // Association between "functionName" and "returnedValue" happens during
  // the compile phase, before the code is executed.
  ```

  ```js
  // Function as an expression
  // Could be "let", "var"
  const functionName = function(coolThings) {
    // ...
    return returnedValue;
  }
  // (Diff from func declaration) Function expression is not associated with
  // its identifier until that statement during runtime.
  ```

- ==Function are values that can be assigned and passed as an argument.== It's a special type of object.

- Functions can be assigned as properties of objects

  ```js
  var whatToSay = {
    greeting() { console.log("Hello!"); },
    question() { console.log("What's your name?"); },
    answer() { console.log("My name is Kyle."); }
  };
  whatToSay.greeting(); // Hello!
  ```

- **[Appendix A](#appendix-a-—-exploring-further)** — So many function forms

  - *Named function expression*

    ```js
    // Could be "let" or "var"
    const awesomeFunc = function someName(arg) {
      // ...
      return amzingStuff;
    }
    awesomeFunc.name; // "someName"
    // "awesomeFunc" and "someName" are only linked at the runtime
    // 👌 They should have the same name!
    ```

  - Should a function have a name? → "*In my opinion [Kyle's], if a function exists in your program, it has a purpose; otherwise, take it out! And if it has a purpose, it has a natural name that describes that purpose.*"

  - Some more forms (early 2020, maybe more)

    ```js
    // generator function declaration
    function *two() { .. }

    // async function declaration
    async function three() { .. }

    // async generator function declaration
    async function *four() { .. }

    // named function export declaration (ES6 modules)
    export function five() { .. }
    ```

    ```js
    // IIFE
    (function(){ .. })();
    (function namedIIFE(){ .. })();

    // asynchronous IIFE
    (async function(){ .. })();
    (async function namedAIIFE(){ .. })();
    ```

  - *Arrow function expression*

    ```js
    var f;
    f = () → 42;
    f = x → x * 2;
    f = (x) → x * 2;
    f = (x,y) → x * y;
    f = x → ({ x: x * 2 });
    f = x → { return x * 2; };
    f = async x → {
      var y = await doSomethingAsync(x);
      return y * 2;
    };
    someOperation( x → x * 2 );
    ```

    - "*Since I don’t think anonymous functions are a good idea to use frequently in your programs, ==I’m not a fan of using the `→` arrow function form==.*"

  - As *methods* in classes

    ```js
    class SomethingKindaGreat {
      // class methods
      coolMethod() { .. }        // no commas!
      boringMethod() { .. }
    }
    var EntirelyDifferent = {
      // object methods
      coolMethod() { .. },       // commas!
      boringMethod() { .. },
        // (anonymous) function expression property
        oldSchool: function() { .. }
    };
    ```

### Comparisons

- **Equal...ish**

  - We must be aware of the differences between an **equality** and **equivalence** comparisons.

  - "Triple equal" `===` ← ==Checking both the value and the type== (in fact, **all** comparisons in JS, not just `===`, does consider the type but `===` disallow any kind of conversion while others do)

    ```jsx
    3 === 3.0;              // true
    "yes" === "yes";        // true
    null === null;          // true
    false === false;        // true

    42 === "42";            // false
    "hello" === "Hello"     // false
    true === 1;             // fasle
    0 === null;             // fasle
    "" === null;            // fasle
    null === undefined;     // fasle
    ```

  - `===` is lying (not really "strict"),

    ```jsx
    NaN === NaN;                            // false
    Number.isNaN(NaN) === Number.isNaN(NaN) // true

    0 === -0;               // true
    Object.is(0, -0)        // false ← should use it, like an "===="
    ```

  - `===` isn't a *structural equality* but *identity equality* for object values ← ==In JS, all object values are held by reference=== (cf. [App. A — Values vs References](#value-vs-reference))

    ```jsx
    [ 1, 2, 3 ] === [ 1, 2, 3 ]         // false
    { a: 42 } === { a: 42 }             // false
    ( x → x * 2) === ( x → x * 2 )    // false
    ```

    ```jsx
    var x = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
    var y = x;
    y === x;            // true (Both point to the same "reference")
    y === [ 1, 2, 3]    // false
    x === [ 1, 2, 3]    // false
    ```

  - "Deep comparison" for "structural equality" is more complicated than you think (even if you stringify them and then compare, it's not always correct). That's why JS doesn't give any mechanism for this.

- **Coercive Comparisons**

  - **Coercion** means a value of one type being converted to its respective representation in another type.

    ```jsx
    42 == "42";       // true ("42" is converted to number)
    1 == true;        // true
    ```

    ```jsx
    // Allowed but avoid to use
    "" == 0;       // true
    0 == false;    // true
    ```

  - If the comparison is between the ==same value type, both `==` and `===` do exactly the same thing, no difference whatsoever==.

  - Why not just use `===`? → Because `>`, `<`, `>=`, `←` use coercive also!

    ```jsx
    var arr = [ "1", "10", "100", "1000" ];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length && arr[i] < 500; i++) {
      // will run 3 times
    }
    ```

    ```jsx
    // Watch out
    var x = "10"
    var y = "9"
    var x = 9
    x < y // true (use alphabetical comparison of string instead)
    x < z // false
    ```

    - It’s still pretty likely you’re going to run into a case where the types may differ.

### How We Organize in JS

Two major patterns: **Classes** and **Modules**.

- **Classes**

  - A class in a program is a definition of a "type" of custom data structure that includes both data and behaviors that operate on that data.
  - Classes define how data structure works but not themselves concrete values. → to get a concrete value of a class, use `new` to *instantiate* it!

  ```jsx
  class Page {
    constructor(text) {
      this.text = text;
    }

    print() {
      console.log(this.text);
    }
  }

  class Notebook {
    constructor() {
      this.pages = [];
    }

    addPage(text) {
      var page = new Page(text);
      this.pages.push(page);
    }

    print() {
      for (let page of this.pages) {
        page.print();
      }
    }
  }

  var mathNotes = new Notebook();
  mathNotes.addPage("Arithmetic: + - * / ...");
  mathNotes.addPage("Trigonometry: sin cos tan ...");
  mathNotes.print();
  // ..
  ```

  - Behaviors (methods) can be only called by instance, not the classes, eg. `mathNotes.addPage()`.

- **Class Inheritance**

  ```jsx
  // Base class
  class Publication {
    constructor(title, author, pubDate) {
      this.title = title;
      this.author = author;
      this.pubDate = pubDate;
    }

    print() {
      console.log(`Title: ${this.title}, By: ${this.author}, On: ${this.pubDate}`);
    }
  }
  ```

  ```jsx
  // Extended classes
  class Book extends Publication {
    constructor(bookDetails) {
      super(bookDetails.title, bookDetails.author, bookDetails.pubishedOn);
      this.publisher = bookDetails.publisher;
      this.ISBN = bookDetails.ISBN;
    }

    print() { // overrides parent's print()
      super.print(); // call (again) parent's print()
      console.log(`Publisher: ${this.publisher}, ISBN: ${this.ISBN}.`);
    }
  }

  class BlogPost extends Publication {
    constructor(title,author,pubDate,URL) {
      super(title,author,pubDate);
      this.URL = URL;
    }

    print() {
      super.print();
        console.log(this.URL);
    }
  }
  ```

  - `super()` delegates to parent's constructor for its initial- ization work.
  - Parent's `print()` and child's `print()` can have the same name and co-exits → called ***polymorphism***!

  ```jsx
  var YDKJS = new Book({
      title: "You Don't Know JS",
    author: "Kyle Simpson",
    publishedOn: "June 2014",
    publisher: "O'Reilly",
    ISBN: "123456-789"

- **Modules**

  - Like classes, modules can "include" or "access" the adata and behaviors of other modules.

  - From the early days of JS, modules was an important and common pattern, even without a dedicated syntax.

  - **Classical module**

    ```jsx
    function Publication(title,author,pubDate) {
      var publicAPI = {
        print() {
          console.log(`Title: ${this.title}, By: ${this.author}, On: ${this.pubDate}`);
        }
      };
      return publicAPI;
    }

    function Book(bookDetails) {
      var pub = Publication(
        bookDetails.title,
        bookDetails.author,
        bookDetails.publishedOn
      );
        var publicAPI = {
        print() {
          pub.print();
          console.log(`Publisher: ${this.publisher}, ISBN: ${this.ISBN}.`);
        }
      };
      return publicAPI;
    }

    function BlogPost(title,author,pubDate,URL) {
      var pub = Publication(title,author,pubDate);
        var publicAPI = {
          print() {
            pub.print();
            console.log(URL);
          }
        };
        return publicAPI;
    }
    ```

    - In classes, data and methods are accessed with `this.` while modules, they're accessed as identifier variables in scope.

    ```tsx
    // Their usage
    var YDKJS = Book({...});
    YDKJS.print();

    var forAgainstLet = BlogPost();
    forAgainstLet.print();
    ```

    - The only difference is with/without `new`!

  - **ES Modules** (ESM).

    - 3 different things compared to the classicial modules,

      1. No need to define a wrapper function, ==ESMs are always file-based==, one file one module.
      2. Whenever we wanna make an API public, use `export`, otherwise, we cannot call this API from another module.
      3. We don't "instantitate" an ESM, use `import` instead.

    - Rewrite above publication module as,

      ```jsx
      // publication.js
      function printDetails(title,author,pubDate) {
        console.log(`...`);
      }
      
      export function create(title,author,pubDate) {
        var publicAPI = {
          print() {
            printDetails(title,author,pubDate);
          }
        };
          return publicAPI;
      }
      ```

      ```jsx
      // blogpost.js
      import { create as createPub } from "publication.js";
      
      function printDetails(pub,URL) {
        pub.print();
        console.log(URL);
      }
      
      export function create(title,author,pubDate,URL) {
        var pub = createPub(title,author,pubDate);
          var publicAPI = {
          print() {
            printDetails(pub,URL);
          }
        };
        return publicAPI;
      }
      ```

      ```jsx
      // main.js
      import { create as newBlogPost } from "blogpost.js";
      
      var forAgainstLet = newBlogPost(...);
      forAgainstLet.print();
      ```

### The Rabbit Hole Deepens

- Recall, this chapter is just like a "brief" of JS world.
- =="I'm serious when I suggest: re-read this chapter, maybe several times."==
- Next chapters, we dig more.

### Values vs References{:#value-vs-reference}

- If you assign/pass a value itself, the value is copied. ==Primitives are held by values.==

  ```jsx
  var myName = "Kyle";
  var yourName = myName;
  myName = "Thi";
  console.log(myName);   // Thi
  console.log(yourName); // Kyle
  ```

- References are the idea that two or more variables are pointing at the same value. Edit one, others change. ==In JS, only object values (arrays, objects, functions,...) are treated as references.==

  ```jsx
  var myAddress = {
    street: "123 JS Blvd".
    city: "Austin",
    state: "TX"
  }
  var yourAddress = myAddress;
  
  myAddress.street = "456 TS Ave";
  console.log(yourAddress.street); // 456 TS Ave
  ```
